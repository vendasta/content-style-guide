Adhering to rules of grammar helps us keep our writing clear and consistent. 

This section will lay out our house style, which applies to all of our content unless otherwise noted in this guide. (We cover a lot of ground in this section—the search feature will help if you're looking for something in particular.)

## Basics

**Write for all readers.** Some people will read every word you write. Others will just skim. Help everyone read better by grouping related ideas together and using descriptive headers and subheaders.

**Focus your message.** Create a hierarchy of information. Lead with the main point or the most important content, in sentences, paragraphs, sections, and pages.

**Be concise.** Use short words and sentences. Avoid unnecessary modifiers.

**Be specific.** Avoid vague language. Cut the fluff.

**Be consistent.** Stick to the copy patterns and style points outlined in this guide.

## Guidelines

### Abbreviations and acronyms

If there’s a chance your reader won’t recognize an abbreviation or acronym, spell it out the first time you mention it. Then use the short version for all other references. If the abbreviation isn’t clearly related to the full version, specify in parentheses.

- First use: single keyword adgroup (SKAG)
- Second use: SKAG
- First use: Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)
- Second use: UTC

If the abbreviation or acronym is well known, like SEO or HTML, use it instead (and don’t worry about spelling it out).

### Active voice

Use active voice. Avoid passive voice.

In active voice, the subject of the sentence does the action. In passive voice, the subject of the sentence has the action done to it.

- Yes: Marti logged into the account.
- No: The account was logged into by Marti.

Words like “was” and “by” may indicate that you’re writing in passive voice. Scan for these words and rework sentences where they appear.

One exception is when you want to specifically emphasize the action over the subject. In some cases, this is fine.

- Your account was flagged by our abuse team.

### Capitalization

We use a few different forms of capitalization. Title case capitalizes the first letter of every word except articles, prepositions, and conjunctions. Sentence case capitalizes the first letter of the first word.

When writing out an email address or website URL, use all lowercase.

- freddie@vendasta.com
- vendasta.com

Don't capitalize random words in the middle of sentences. Here are some words that we never capitalize in a sentence. For more, see the [Word List](/content-style-guide/16-word-list/).

- website
- internet
- online
- email

### Contractions

They’re great! They give your writing an informal, friendly tone. In most cases, use them as you see fit.

### Emoji

Emoji are a fun way to add humor and visual interest to your writing, but use them infrequently and deliberately.

### Numbers

Spell out a number when it begins a sentence and when it is less than 10. Otherwise, use the numeral. This includes ordinals, too.

- Eight cofounders started Vendasta, and now we employ more than 300 people.
- I ate three donuts at Tim Hortons.
- Meg won first place in last year’s Walktober contest.
- We hosted a group of eighth graders who are learning to code.

(Sometimes it feels weird to use "one" instead of "1." Just go with your gut.) 

Numbers over 3 digits get commas:

- 999
- 1,000
- 150,000

Anything in the millions and beyond is partially written for readability. Apply the same rules with numerics under 10 that precedes the “million” or “billion”. The only exceptions are dollar figures or decimals, where written amounts is preferred. Like so:

Nine million, but:
10 million
10.2 million
$5 million

Abbreviate them if there are space restraints, as in a tweet or a chart: 1k, 150k.


#### Dates

Generally, spell out the day of the week and the month. Abbreviate only if space is an issue in the app.

- Saturday, January 24
- Sat., Jan. 24
- January, 2022
- Fall, 2050


#### Decimals and fractions

Spell out fractions.

- Yes: two-thirds
- No: 2/3

Use decimal points when a number can’t be easily written out as a fraction, like 1.375.

#### Percentages

In titles and subtitles: Use the % symbol.
In body text: Use percent (no space).


#### Ranges and spans

Use a hyphen (-) to indicate a range or span of numbers.

- It takes 20-30 days.

#### Money

When writing about US currency, use the dollar sign before the amount. Include a decimal and number of cents if more than 0.

- $20
- $19.99

For other countries who use dollars (like Canada), apply the currency code after the dollar amount.

- $20 CAD
- $19.99 AUD

When writing about other currencies, follow the same symbol-amount format:

- ¥1
- €1

#### Telephone numbers

Use dashes without spaces between numbers. Use a country code if your reader is in another country.

- 555-867-5309
- +1-404-123-4567

#### Time

Use numerals and am or pm, without a space in between. Don’t use minutes for on-the-hour time. 

- 7am 
- 7:30pm

Use a hyphen between times to indicate a time period. 

- 7am-10:30pm

Specify time zones when writing about an event or something else people would need to schedule, and be sure to include whether it’s daylight time or standard time. Abbreviate time zones within the Americas as follows:

- Eastern daylight time: EDT
- Central standard time: CST
- Mountain daylight time: MDT
- Pacific daylight time: PDT

Decades should be referred to in numerics to avoid confusion and improve readability:

- The 1900s
- The 1800s
- The 1980s
- The 1990s
- The 2000s
- The 2010s


### Punctuation

#### Apostrophes

The apostrophe’s most common use is making a word possessive. If the word already ends in an s and it’s singular, you also add an ‘s. If the word ends in an s and is plural, just add an apostrophe.

- The donut thief ate Sam’s donut.
- The donut thief ate Chris’s donut.
- The donut thief broke all of the donut shops’ windows.

Apostrophes can also be used to denote that you’ve dropped some letters from a word, usually for humor or emphasis. This is fine, but do it sparingly.

#### Colons

Use a colon (rather than an ellipsis, em dash, or comma) to offset a list.

- Erin ordered 3 kinds of donuts: glazed, chocolate, and pumpkin.

#### Commas

When writing a list, use the serial comma (also known as the Oxford comma). 

- Yes: David admires his parents, Oprah, and Justin Timberlake.
- No: David admires his parents, Oprah and Justin Timberlake.

Otherwise, use common sense. If you’re unsure, read the sentence out loud. Where you find yourself taking a breath, use a comma.

#### Dashes and hyphens

Use a hyphen (-) without spaces on either side to link words into single phrase, or to indicate a span or range. 

- first-time user
- Monday-Friday

Use an em dash (—) without spaces on either side to offset an aside. Also, use a true em dash, not hyphens (- or --).

- Multivariate testing—just one of our new Pro features—can help you grow your business.
- Austin thought Brad was the donut thief, but he was wrong—it was Lain.

#### Ellipses

Ellipses (...) can be used to indicate that you’re trailing off before the end of a thought. Use them sparingly in formal communications, but don’t be afraid to use them for emphasis or drama in places like social posts. Don’t use them in headers or titles.

- “Where did all those donuts go?” Christy asked. Lain said, “I don't know...”

#### Periods

Periods go inside quotation marks. They go outside parentheses when the parenthetical is part of a larger sentence, and inside parentheses when the parenthetical stands alone.

- Christy said, “I ate a donut.”
- I ate a donut (and I ate a bagel, too).
- I ate a donut and a bagel. (The donut was Sam’s.)

Leave a single space between sentences. 

#### Question marks

Question marks go inside quotation marks if they’re part of the quote. Like periods, they go outside parentheses when the parenthetical is part of a larger sentence, and inside parentheses when the parenthetical stands alone.

#### Exclamation points

Use exclamation points sparingly, and never more than one at a time. They’re like high-fives: A well-timed one is great, but too many can be annoying.

Exclamation points go inside quotation marks. Like periods and question marks, they go outside parentheses when the parenthetical is part of a larger sentence, and inside parentheses when the parenthetical stands alone.

Never use exclamation points in failure messages or alerts. When in doubt, avoid!

#### Quotation marks

Use quotes to refer to words and letters, titles of short works (like articles and poems), and direct quotations.

Periods and commas go within quotation marks. Question marks within quotes follow logic—if the question mark is part of the quotation, it goes within. If you’re asking a question that ends with a quote, it goes outside the quote.

Use single quotation marks for quotes within quotes.

- Who was it that said, “A fool and his donut are easily parted”?
- Brad said, “A wise man once told me, ‘A fool and his donut are easily parted.’”

#### Semicolons

Go easy on semicolons. They usually support long, complicated sentences that could easily be simplified. Try an em dash (—) instead, or simply start a new sentence.

#### Ampersands

Don't use ampersands unless one is part of a company or brand name.

- Ben and Dan
- Ben & Jerry’s

### People, Places, and Things

#### File extensions

When referring generally to a file extension type, use all uppercase without a period. Add a lowercase s to make plural.

- GIF
- PDF
- HTML
- JPGs

When referring to a specific file, the filename should be lowercase:

- slowclap.gif
- MCBenefits.pdf
- ben-twitter-profile.jpg
- ilovedonuts.html

#### Pronouns

If your subject’s gender is unknown or irrelevant, use “they,” “them,” and “their” as a singular pronoun. Use “he/him/his” and “she/her/her” pronouns as appropriate. Don’t use “one” as a pronoun.

#### Quotes

When quoting someone in a blog post or other publication, use the present tense.

- “Using Vendasta has helped our business grow,” says Jamie Smith.

The only exception is press releases or self-published news articles, which follows American Press style (or the style a publication uses, such as Canadian Press). In these limited cases, we’re highlighting a point in time, so we would use past tense (as if we’re reporting that someone ‘said’ something in the past):

“Using Vendasta has helped our business grow,” said Jamie Smith.


#### Names and titles

The first time you mention a person in writing, refer to them by their first and last names. On all other mentions, refer to them by their first name.

Capitalize the names of departments and teams (but not the word "team" or "department").

- Marketing team
- Support department

Don't capitalize when referring to a specific role or a role in general terms.

- Our new marketing manager starts today.
- All the managers ate donuts. 

Don't refer to someone as a “ninja,” “rockstar,” or “wizard” unless they literally are one.

#### States, cities, and countries

Spell out all city and state names. Don’t abbreviate city names.

Per AP Style, all cities should be accompanied by their state, with the exception of: Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Honolulu, Houston, Indianapolis, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, New Orleans, New York, Oklahoma City, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, Salt Lake City, San Antonio, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, Washington.

On first mention, write out United States. On subsequent mentions, US is fine. The same rule applies to any other country or federation with a common abbreviation (European Union, EU; United Kingdom, UK).

#### URLs and websites

Capitalize the names of websites and web publications. Don’t italicize.

Avoid spelling out URLs, but when you need to, leave off the http://www.

## White Label

The phrase "white label" is one of the trickiest terms to grasp for a lot of people. As a noun, it is two separate words. As an adjective modifying a noun, it is hyphenated. It is never written as one word without a hyphen.

- CORRECT: We support white labeling for vendor products.
- CORRECT: Vendasta offers a white-label platform.
- NOT CORRECT: Vendasta offers a whitelabel platform.
- NOT CORRECT: Vendasta offers a white label platform.
